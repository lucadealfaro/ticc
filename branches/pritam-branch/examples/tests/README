This directory contains some test examples, to check that TICC works
correctly.  To run the tests, write: 

  ./do-tests *.in

To re-initialize the tests, saying that their current output is the
desired output, do:

  ./do-tests -set *.in 

(and, if you are a TICC developer, remember to do cvs commit afterwards!)

The files have the following meaning: 

.in	Ocaml script files that run the examples
.si	Sociable interfaces
.oko    (Output ok) : what the output should be like
.out	what the output was like
.diff	difference from .oko and .out
