(* 
Action boum increases x both in A and in B.  Since A and B can also
emit boum, the only way A and B are compatible is if x is kept in
synch at the same value.  Unfortunately, this is not the case, as B
can receive action bump which increases x in B only. The input
restriction of bump says therefore that this cannot happen.
