Installation
============

To make the executable, first build glue:  

    $ cd src/glu-2.0
    $ touch configure
    $ ./configure
    $ make

Then, make Ticc: 

    $ cd ../..
    $ make 

To make the documentation, do: 

    $ make doc

The result is left in the doc/api directory; look in particular at 
Ticc.html.
