This directory contains documented examples for Ticc.
Each example comes with two files: a ".si" file and a ".in" file.
The ".si" file contains the model (sociable interface) description
for the example.  The ".in" file is OCaml code which demonstrates
how to load the model and operate on it.

If you are new to Ticc, you should proceed through the examples
in the following order:

Example
===============================================================
fire-detector            A very simple smoke alarm system with
                         three modules, each with only three states.
			 This example is intended as an introduction
			 to the general technique of creating a module,
			 and also tries to explain some of the
			 syntax and semantics that you should be aware of.

fire-detector-disable    A more interesting version of the above, with
                         fewer comments.  The example is described in
                         a techrep. 

printer-s-frocos         Another simple example, of two users sending
                         print jobs to a printer.  These files are
			 also commented pretty heavily, as a demonstration
			 of going from a transition diagram to Ticc module.
                         The simulate function is used in this example to
                         do random simulation.

printer-s-frocos-clone   This is a version of the previous example that uses
                         the clone function.

printer-nak              This example is almost the same as printer-s-frocos. 
                         An action nack is added to refuse jobs whose size
		         is greater than 4.

fire-detector-disable    This is an extended version of the fire-detector,
                         which a new action that can permanently disable
			 the Control Unit.  There is a more detailed
			 explanation of how this example works, on the
			 tool wiki.
